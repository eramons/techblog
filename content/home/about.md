There are tons of technical posts available on the Internet, about everything you can imagine and beyond. This blog might look like more of the same - and maybe it is. These posts are a collection of step-by-step guides summarizing my experiences when trying out new stuff. At the end, it's just a slightly better way to keep my notes organised than having bunches of text files randomly distributed through several devices :)
