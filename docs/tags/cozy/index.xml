      <description>Goal:
Set up a minimal Kubernetes cluster on Rapberry Pi 4.
I ordered a new Raspberry Pi 4 a couple of days ago. I already use one at work for automated testing and I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool, but I actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what I wanted it for. After giving it a thought, I decided to install Rancher&amp;rsquo;s K3S distribution on it, turning it to a convenient, low-power-consumption, single-node K8s distribution I can use as a playground.</description>

      <description>Goal:
Deploy cozy on my homemade kubernetes cluster
The K8s homemade cluster on baremetal was meant to be just an exercise and not a permanent setup. Still, I needed to find something to deploy on it :)
I decided to try out Cozy Cloud deploying software and dependencies as containers in my K8s cluster.
Cozy is a personal, free and self-hostable cloud platform, written in Go.
Milestones  Pre-requisites: make sure the infrastructure is ready Cozy Software: installation, dependencies and configuration Docker Images: which one are available and which new ones we need K8s Configuration: write manifests for deployment in the cluster Cozy instance: create a new cozy instance and test it  1.</description>
