      <description>Goal:
Self-host Nextcloud on Kubernetes and use it as server-side for the /e operating system
Nextcloud offers an on-premises content collaboration platform, which is open-source and free. The Nextcloud server is written in the PHP and JavaScript scripting languages.
The /e/ ROM is a fork of Android (more precisely from LineageOS).
See previous post to see how to install the OS on a LG G3 and my efforts to self-host the /e server beta version.</description>
